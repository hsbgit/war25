Clan EviL Map Pack v1.0
Thank you for downloading!!

---01.16.2015---

This map pack was done as a service to WarCraft II Server.War2.Ru 
Community in a effort to help bring back the legacy of custom games 
to the server. This assortment of maps would not have been possible if it
were not for the numerous gamers who had took the time and effort to submit
me their map collection. So, I would personally like to say thank you to all
of you.

Happy Gaming!
