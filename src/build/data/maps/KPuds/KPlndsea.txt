Description:  A four player map which requires control of both the land 
              and the sea.  Player positions are connected by narrow paths 
              which can be attacked from the sea and all expansion mines 
              are on islands so sea power is critical for expansion.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are opposite so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies opposite each other.
