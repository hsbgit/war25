Description:  This is an Air/Water map for 8 players. In an 8-player, it will be
              a fight over the center mines since they are the 2 biggest mines.
              The outside mines in the center are small and won't last long.  
              Space is a little tight on the sea, so lots of juggs will probably
              get stuck.  Catapaults may be a good idea too. 

Game Setup:   Starting positions are adjacent, so fixed order, TVB, would place 
              allies next to each other and teams opposite each other in four
              player games or players in alternating slots if the odd positions
              are used.
