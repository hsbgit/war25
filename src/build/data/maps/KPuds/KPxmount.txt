Description:  The map is just a big X-shaped mountain, with each player 
              starting at an angle of the X.  There's trees all round, a 
              little like Garden, but plenty of room for building.  You 
              start with a 40,000 mine each, and there is a 60,000 mine at
              the end of each side of the X.  I hate unimaginative, 
              straight-line puds as much as anyone, so I've spent some time
              making it look fairly professional.

              The shape, and size, of the map make grunt rushing very 
              difficult: by the time your guys get to your neighbour's 
              town, he is bound to have more unless he is very slow 
              (another 'ogre rules' pud, hehe).  Each of the four rock 
              walls has a thin place about half way along which you could 
              blast through with 1 or 2 sappers to sneak in a surprise 
              attack - could happen to you, of course :)  The map seems 
              really big because everyone is fairly close together in the 
              middle, separated by far too much rock to sapper through.  
              The other players' peasants should be too far to blizzard, 
              and the middle mines should be finished by the time you have
              mages anyway. This is a cool map for FFA, because everyone 
              has an enemy on each side, and you'll have to fight each 
              neighbour over the corner mines.  The strategy for teams is 
              completely different, and depends whether you're next to you
              partner or opposite - I'll let you work it out for yourself 
              though, hahaha.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are adjacent so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies next to each other.
