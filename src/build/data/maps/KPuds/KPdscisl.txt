Description:  'Island of Discovery' is a pud that starts everyone out on small
              islands and which then forces them into the centre large island 
              where fighting over resources really takes place.  Gold, lumber,
              oil, and island sizes are pretty much equal, and both sea and land
              fighting will be required.  All resources are very scarce for an
              eight player game so early fighting over resources should be 
              intense.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are alternating so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies in adjacent corners in a 4 player game and teams in
              alternating slots in an 8 player game.
