Author Info:  just a wc2 fanatic

Description:  This is a very unique level that adds a few new concepts to wc2. 
              First, all players no start on 2 islands (1 of their own, 1 shared
              with their opponents) This allows for some very intense strategy
              as you must now control 2 spots from the beginning. If you dont
              like this idea, just use the one peseant option. 

Hints:        This level doesn't work well with computer players.  They tend to
              get confused from the 2 starting locations.
