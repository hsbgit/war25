Description:  Similar to Plains of Snow, this map has several medium to small
              sized gold mines with a large one in the center.  It is just an 
              overall fun pud to play.  With so many gold mines, good recon is
              essential, and anything is possible.  There is no sure to win
              strat on this pud, and it should be fun on any resource level.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are adjacent so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies next to each other in a 2vs2 or 2vs2vs2vs2 game.
              In a 4vs4 game, fixed order would put one team on the top and
              one team on the bottom.
