This is my attempt to combine land and sea in a balanced manner.  It is
possible to reach all players by land, but a naval force may be helpful 
because there are some extra mines on an island in the middle of the map
and attacking by only land can be defended against. I recommend you use 
both land and sea to attack the enemies. I start every player with $60000.
On the middle island there are two additional mines with $40000 in each of
them. 

Anyway enough talk... time to play! 

Gotcha.
