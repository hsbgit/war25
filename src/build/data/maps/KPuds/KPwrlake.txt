Description:  This PUD is somewhat unique to my knowledge, because it offers 
              equal opportunity to attack over land and over water.  Each player
              starts with a town hall which is on the shore of a large circular
              lake in the center of the board.  Players may reach each other by
              building ships early to attack other player's town halls, or by 
              building land units and moving them around the various obstacles
              to reach the other towns on land.  Because the starting positions
              are defensible to land attack but somewhat vulnerable to water 
              attack, this PUD strikes an excellent balance between being a land
              level and a water level, simultaneously.  An added bonus for 
              having water superiority is being able to access the 120,000 gold
              mine in an island on the center of the lake.  
 
Game Setup:   Starting positions are adjacent so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies next to each other.
