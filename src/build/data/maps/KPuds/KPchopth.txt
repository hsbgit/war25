Description:  Chop to your Neighbors - A six player PUD similar to the 
              Expansion Pack PUD 3vs3 but with some signigicant differences.
              Each player is adjacent to 4 of the other 5 players, so there
              are numberous strategic possibilities regarding which way to
              chop.  Also, some parts of the forest walls are thinner than
              other parts, so every position has directions of highest 
              vulnerability.
   
Game Setup:   Starting positions are such that fixed order, TVB would
              make the teams inside vs outside.
