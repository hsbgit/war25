Description: A water map with several ways to cross.  None of the spots are
             unbalanced, but all are different enough so that you won't use the
             same strategy for each.  You don't start out too close to the water 
             but chances are your next expansion will be vulnerable to sea
             vessels.  Ships are a good idea.  A few spots can be blasted to and
             others hopped, so you never know where your enemy might be.
             Overall, only the best at controlling sea power, land troops, and
             reconnaisance will prevail.              

Hints:       Expand soon with the foundry hop.
