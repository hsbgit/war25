Description:  Starting positions are on small individual land pieces that all 
              connect to a central mine. Water is definitely required as 
              lumber resources can run out quickly and many buildings could be 
              vunerable from the ocean depending on where you place them. Those
              that chicken out in the central battle for gold can also move to
              the outside mines for their own safety, but that could become a 
              battle as well if everyone decides to use that ploy.
 
Game Setup:   Starting positions are alternating so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies in non-adjacent slots in 3vs3 or 2vs2vs2 games.
