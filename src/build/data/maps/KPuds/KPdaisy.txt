Design:  Original Design
         Shaped like a Daisy in Full Bloom
         The outline is done in Rock
	
Game:   -Not suggested for play against the computer because of the rock wall
         since the computer will not blast through.
        -Great for Team Play or Free For All.

         would be side by side and enemies across.
