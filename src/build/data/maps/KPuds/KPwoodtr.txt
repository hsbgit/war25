Description:  A four player pud with several unique features.  The map is 
              a collection of 'nodes' or clearings which are connected by 
              trails.  Each player has a choice of where to go to establish
              his initial town - to the corner which is safe with a large 
              clearing and a small gold mine; to the center with a large 
              gold mine and a small vulnerable clearing; or one of the 
              positions in between.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are adjacent so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies next to each other.
