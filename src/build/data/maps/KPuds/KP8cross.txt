Description:  This map is a great cross between land and sea. You need sea 
              control to make attacks or to expand.  You could also go and and
              sapper through rocks to reach expansions and opponents. Great 
              Multiplayer map.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are opposite so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies opposite each other.
