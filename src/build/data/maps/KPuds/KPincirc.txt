Description:  This PUD is an 8 player kind of land and sea NWTR style map.  Great
              for ffa's since building space is very cramped so you can hit your
              opponents from across the rocks which separate you.  You have many
              options of attack - from controlling the sea, to sappering through,
              to just blizzarding or D&D'ing from over the rocks and wearing your
              opponent down that way.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are alternating.  In four player games, fixed
              order, TVB would place allies next to each other, with empty slots
              between them.  In 4vs4 games, fixed order, TVB would place teams
              in alternating slots.
