Description:  This is probably the best gow remake out there.  Its not taken 
              directly from gow, but it's obviously based on it.  All the 
              starting spots are fair now as everyone can wall-in and nobody's 
              mine can be towered early.  There are just enough mines around and
              the "middle" is still there. Works great as a multi-player map or 
              a computer map.
