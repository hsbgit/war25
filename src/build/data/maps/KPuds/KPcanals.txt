Description:  An eight player sea map where islands are separated by canals.
              Each island has a main mine and an expansion mine.  The 
              expansion mines are vulnerable to direct attack from the sea.
              Like all 'channel' maps, ship movement is restricted and ships
              can be attacked from land as they pass through the canals.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are opposite so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies opposite each other.
