Description:  Rush to the Gold Fields - When the original mines run dry, all
              the extra resources are to the North.  Unlike most maps, where
              expansion mines are in the center and arranged so each player has
              one or two which are close, Gold Rush expansion mines are a free 
              for all.  A warning - don't let yourself get towered in!

Game Setup:   Starting positions are alternating so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies separated by enemies.
