You have downloaded a file that is part of the Warcraft II KPUD set.  PC
users should install the KPUD files in the main War2 directory.  Mac users
should install them in the Custom PUDs folder.  In order to play a PUD on
the internet, everyone in the game must have that PUD installed in the
same folder and this setup will allow PC and Mac users to play in the same
game.  

If you have not done so, we encourage you to visit the KPUD home page to
find out what the KPUD project is all about.
