Description:  This map is a modification of the original One Way In, One Way Out.
              The default units include a trannie to allow for either a quick
              attack or a quick expansion to the mines on the right.  The trannie 
              is the "First Way In."  The "Second Way In" is via sappers.  There 
              is a river in the mountain with a small break in the river so the
              sappers are channeled through that one pass.

              The main mines are 40k, the expansion mines 55k, and the island 
              mines are 30k each.  The distance from the main mines to the 
              expansion mines is equidistant and the distance from each 
              expansion mine to the river in the mountain is equidistant.  This 
              is to allow both opponents an equal shot at sappering just to the
              river and doing spells across at the peon gold line.
