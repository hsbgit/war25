A special thanks to Alter_Ego for the idea of a Hopping .pud

Another special thanks to MadDawg for the use of his .pud modified to fit 
this scenario.  Please read the .txt of Highsea2.pud to see all his credits.

Important:  You must know how to use the shipyard/Foundry hop to play this 
map.  First you need to know that when a building is completed the peon will
pop out of that building at the upper left corner.  If that spot is already
taken, he will pop out below that.  If that spot is covered he will pop out 
of the building in the first open spot going around the building in a 
counter-clockwise direction.

Now if you build a shipyard in a narrow canal, the same rules apply.  If you
want him to pop out on the other side of the canal, the first opening from 
the shipyard must be on the other side of the canal.  Sometimes this takes 
practice to figure out completely.  This can be done with a shipyard, a 
foundry, or even a refinery.  But unless you actually want the building, you
need to hit escape or cancel as soon as you start the building process.  
This is cheaper and much faster than building the entire building just to 
hop across.

If you cannot put the building in a position to make the peon pop out on the
other side, you can take excess units , i.e. peons, and have them stand on 
the near side of the bank to have the peon who is constructing actually pop 
out on the other side.  It is important to note that if you are going to 
cancel the building construction, do not have the other peons assist in the 
build since that would be a further waste of resources.
