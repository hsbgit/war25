I love water, and I wanted a high seas type map with more fairness, smaller
mines.  It was originally called High Seas 2, but it turns out it's not 
simply a High Seas Clone.

I also added a few more features that would make it more interesting.  It's
completely foundry hoppable both ways to each island using only one peon.  
There's the fight for the 2 mines in the middle.  There's less resources to
generate a bigger fight for the middle and expansions.  There's approx. 
equal lumber for all players

It's a hybrid of HSC, Fierce Ocean Combat, and Critter Attack.

Credits go to:
Me :)
Whoever created those great sea maps for the cd.  I used those ideas for 
     asthetic design.
MugWump (Bill Wright, creator of KPUDs) for suggestions.
Anvil for telling me about some bugs.
Cnight, for giving me great suggestions for pud design, and for saying my 
    other puds were crap :)
All those who play me water, and who make me enjoy it so much.
