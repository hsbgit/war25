Lots of gold, lots of oil, and a terrain that is designed with defense
in mind.  Attacks will be difficult and the large gold mines will
insure a long battle.

Some hints about this map ...

o Take advantage of the rock formations when defending the land
  bridge.  Position your men so that only one attacker can get through
  while you use two or three defenders (see diagram).
     aaaaaaa
     fffffff          KEY: X rock
    XXeXeXeXX              f (your) footmen
     XeXeXeX               a (your) archers
     X X X X               e enemy

  As the attacker comes through the single file path in the rock,
  three defenders gang up on him.  Make sure you tell the defenders to
  stand ground.  Put archers (or a catapult!) behind your defenders
  for added protection.  A similar approach can be used at the center
  cross road.

o The only open area for a sea attack is the back of the island.  You
  can place three ships across the sea lane in the back to cut off
  access to the back of your island.  If you don't want to bother with
  ships, four strategically placed farms will wall off the back of the
  island (that is, until you chop throught the trees).

o The rocky shores have shelves where a transport could land a sapper
  or two.  Be prepared for it.

Have at it!
