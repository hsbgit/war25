Description:  This map is not totally original but was derived from a pud
              found in some pud archive.  The separation of the positons
              by the complex center area should make for long games since
              an early rush is unlikely.  The edge expansion mines are
              just out of range of blizzard, but after sappering through
              the rocks, mages can blizzard the peon line from behind the
              trees.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are opposite so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies opposite each other.
