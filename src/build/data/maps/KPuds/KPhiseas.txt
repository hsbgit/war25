High Seas Combat 2 (Text file by MadDawg, pud by many, see credits)

Background:  Well after Diablo died out, there was great demand for cool
4on4 water maps.  We had FOC, HSC, and custom puds like Gotcha!'s whatkey,
but we wanted another one.  Some of us always liked HSC except for the fact
that it had some serious starting location problems.  Red, the position at
the bottom left could be hit by sea as well as orange in the top right corner.  
Then there was major unequalities in lumber and other problems.  So we
decided we wanted to fix it.

A long time ago, someone extracted the regular HSC and fixed it up a tad.
No one knows who this was, if you want credit just email me or whatever.
Well we played on this map, but we didn't like it.  Gotcha pointed out that
there was no reason to take the sea at all.  He mentioned that no one would
need to go sea in it, and said that the map sucked.  I was tired of getting
my ass kicked on whatkey, so I wanted to make the map so that NO ONE would
ever be able to say they lost because of the position they got.  So we
started talking about it, and thought about what we could do to make it good.
LrdSchroeder decided to do the fixing.  I gave him the idea of putting in
an island in the middle that could be defended ONLY by sea, and that land
defense was totally unnecessary at the middle.  So he whipped up the new
center and offered it.

That night and the next day, I worked on it, trying to even out the lumber
and land situation.  But of course, not being careful, I forgot to change
the gold on a couple mines back to 75k.  After a few failed attempts
because the map was so buggy, I was determined to make the "perfect" HSC.
So Lrd and I worked independently at first, then that caused tons of
different names of the pud.  It was a big mess.  I had like hsc++, hsc0.9a,
hsc0.9b (just like Kali95 beta of course :), and this sucked too.

To make this already long story short, I took it from there, making many
of the land mass changes.  There was the problem of too much gold.  We
lowered it to 60k.  There was the problem of being able to blizzard
opponents peon trains from adjacent islands.  There was the problem of
not being able to do a NaTe formation by your hall without it being
bombarded.  Of course I found out about this the hard way.  :)  AND, all of
these suggestions came after every version, so there ended up being like
twenty or so.

One night, Vermeer and I wanted this map to be perfect.  Enough with these
buggy versions we thought.  So we playtested it with cheats on.  (Silverwolf,
you bastard :).  We then tested everything.  Vermeer then snagged it and
made it totally perfect.  :)

******Vermeer's section, directly quoted******
Welp,

MadDawg pretty much covered most of what went on.  I was the one who did
and redid the new rock/river borders (only 2 saps thick) and moved the
2ndary oil around so it was about the same distance from the next closes
spot. 

Most of what I did were the little things, like moving mines and trees
around so starting hall positions were equally defensible, and had equal
access to resources and room enough for decent urban planning.

Of course I dipped my hand in the geography editing, everyone who touched
this map probably did.  Gotta make the world safe from cross border 
dk's.  :)

But of course, the most important thing I did was mess wit the dark/light
water to make it so coastlines are light and the oceans were dark.  I
guess MadDawg really hated the previous splotchiness.

Hats off to everyone who put in their time and effort designing, editing,
and playtesting this thing.  We made it so it would be a great team map,
and it took a great team effort to make it.

Changes:
Gold in original mines lowered to 60k
More land mass, and made it more equal.  (done because of bombardment reasons)
More trees
Added support for the NaTe formation
Changed it so each person has a river on one side and rocks on the other
Took away ability to blizzard halls/peons from adjacent islands
Added the gay looking but cool center.  75k.
Moved oil patches around.
Changed original oil to 12.5k, forcing all out sea players to expand for oil
Made the water prettier.  Shallow water near the shore.  :)
Moved all mines to cool places, with lumber near it for early efficiency
Countless others

Credits:
Whoever originally exported the pud.
LrdSchroeder for doing all of the early work on it.
Vermeer for making it TOTALLY perfect.  He did so much to this pud.
        all the changes were kinda small, like beautifying it, and making all
        halls start in the most efficient ways, but without him, this map
        still sucked.  I don't even know everything he did, he's going to
        tell me what he did and I'll append it to this text file.
Everyone who playtested it(sorry for putting you through that ;), and
        everyone who offered their opinions on the map.  You know who you
        are.  Gotcha!, Wermacht, Silverwolf, Warp!, Vermeer, and the thousands
        of others that helped with ideas.  :)
Searon for redoing an early version of the pud and giving me good suggestions.
        Too bad they had already been fixed.  Doh!
Shlonglor for kicking my ass almost every time I play against a team with
        him on it, and for posting it on his page.  :)
MadDawg for revising the dumb map 20 times and offering it over kali about
        200 times, literally.  I did whatever.  I did a lot of changing
        of the land shapes in general, and being the guy who did the
        changes everyone suggested so kindly.

Why are you still reading this?  :)

I hope you like this pud.  Enjoy.
