What is the Ogre Rule?

There is a stupid rule on Kali called the Ogre rule. What the Ogre rule
says is: You cannot attack the enemy until you have Ogres.

This rule was invented because some people (crappy players) find that they
cannot survive long enough to get Ogres. Well with this pud, those guys can 
survive just a little bit longer. But not much, hehe.

This is a much better way to insure people get Ogres, rather than making a 
stupid rule.

This certainly doesn't make this pud not fun to play. This level is cool.

Let me explain a bit about it.

Everyone is surrounded by lumber. To get to the enemy, you have to chop out.
Then you have to either chop into the enemy or sapper into them.

You can make ships. If you do, you can get to the 2 islands where there are 
gold mines with 70,000 in it. You can also try to get the middle mine. You
have to chop into it, or sapper to it. The middle mine has 90,000 in it.
The mines you start off with have 50,000.
