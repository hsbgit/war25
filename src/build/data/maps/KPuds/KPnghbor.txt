Description:  A variation of the friends.pud theme but different in that the
              original requires an assault strategy, while this one requires
              expansion.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are adjacent in a 'friends' setup, so 
              fixed order, TVB, would place allies next to each other and teams
              opposite each other.
