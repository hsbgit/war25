Description:  This pud has been designed for maximum strategic balance between
              land and sea.  Grunts, early expansions, and sea units are all
              potentially important.  Note that on default resources oil must be
              *harvested* in order to upgrade one's town hall, making it a 
              critical resource.

Game Setup:   The starting positions are set up in a clockwise spiral with two
              slots between sequential player positions so that in TVB games, the
              players on the same team would be scattered.
