Description:  Even though water plays an important role in this PUD, this is 
              really a land PUD. Each player starts out on a small island. With
              the few resources you have, build a shipyard and foundry and build
              transports to take your peasants/peons to the main land. Once
              there, you must claim a gold mine, build a town, and destroy your
              enemies also on the main land. This game is perfect for 2x2, and
              six player FFA. Hope you enjoy!  Don't forget to build ships to
              defend your transports, or better yet, attack other players and
              try and cripple them!!!

Game Setup:   Starting positions are set so that in 2vs2 TVB fixed order, allies
              will be adjacent and opponents opposite.
