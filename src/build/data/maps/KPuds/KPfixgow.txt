Description:  A fixed version of Garden of War.  The modifications are:
              - Eliminated the roads thru the start positions that 
                restricted building.
              - Moved mines and added trees to eliminate offensive towering
                of Town Halls.
              - Removed small lake so Town Hall can be built near top 
                middle expansion mine.
              - Made starting positions have equal building areas and 
                ability to wall in.
              - Added trees to eliminate easy yellow access to top middle 
                mine by chopping thru thin tree line.
              - Made black mine the same size as all other start mines.
              - Added a lake in upper right so yellow doesn't have a large
                protected building area.

Game Setup:    Starting positions are adjacent so fixed order, TVB, would
               place allies next to each other.
