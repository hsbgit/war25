There are 9 islands, 8 starts + 1 center. Each start island has a 65k mine & 
lots of wood and not much space. The center island has four 40k mines, lots of 
wood and lots of space compared to the start island.  There are eight 20000 oil
patches and four 25000 oil patches. Be warned, the start islands are tight 
spaces, just the way I like 'em! Haha, croak if you don't. Too much gold?  You 
need to learn how to be greedy ...

Thanks to my friends for testing. Send bug reports, suggestions questions etc
to bobm@aei.ca addressed to Mino so I know its war2 stuff.
