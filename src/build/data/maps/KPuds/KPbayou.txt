Description:  Navigate the Bayou - An eight player pud with plenty of water
              but which is really a land battle.  The combination of the
              narrow passages, which are easily defended by towers, mages,
              and catapults, and the low amount of oil available, makes a 
              large navy impractical.  He who manages his transports most 
              efficiently (e.g., taking advantage of the fact that they can 
              be repaired) will probably be the victor.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are opposite so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies opposite each other.
