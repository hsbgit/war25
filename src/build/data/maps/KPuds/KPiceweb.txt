Description:  Ice Web is a combination of a 'ring' and a 'wheel' PUD.  The
              layout is intentionally geometric and there are no well
              defined clearings for building a town.  Instead, all islands
              are covered with tree clumps which must be chopped away to
              allow building room.  Since there are no typical clearings,
              there is no way to wall-in to prevent being rushed.  To
              compensate for that, the default units include a guard tower.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are opposite so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies opposite each other.
