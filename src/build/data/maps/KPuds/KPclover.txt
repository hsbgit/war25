Description:  Inspired by Numenor, a creation of J. R. R. Tolkien.  All players
              can easily wall in at first.  The starting mines are 65k and there
              is a mine in the center surrounded by trees (150k).  If you don't 
              want to defend that mine against three opponents, you can try to
              get one of the mines on the islands.  They are 60k but can easily
              be attacked by juggs.  There is plenty of wood and oil for
              building up a fleet, though.

Game Setup:   Starting positions are opposite so fixed order, TVB, would
              place allies opposite each other.
