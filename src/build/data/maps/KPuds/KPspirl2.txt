One of my favorite maps to play would have to be The Spiral.  However,
I don't usually like to play on any map size other than 128x128, so in
response to this problem I created The Spiral2.  This map is basically
The Spiral with a few minor changes which include 1) the map size is now
128x128 2) the spiral swirl now goes in the opposite direction 3) The Spiral2
can support 6 players 4) and the terrain is set to snow.  Despite these
changes the map retains the basic look of The Spiral. Enjoy!
