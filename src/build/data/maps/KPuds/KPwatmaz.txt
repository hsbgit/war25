History: By mid-March, almost every single game was either water, or maze.
So one day after people started playing Shaf's Maze2 map, ~Creed~ comes
in kchat and says:

* ~Creed~ has an Idea: A Water Maze!

Everyone thought it was a great idea. The best of both worlds! So right 
away, people started trying to make a water maze. Silverwolf gives up only
after about 5 minutes hahaha so I thought I should try making it. After getting
a few tips from Gotcha!, I started working...

To all those who thought a water maze wasn't possible, Screw you! :)

VERY IMPORTANT: If you are red, don't build your town hall right against the
edge of the map! Or else your peons will pop out of the bottom of your hall
and you will be screwed over.

Credits to: ~Creed~ for coming up with this awesome idea! Without him, this
                    map would not be possible. Thanks ~Creed~!

            Gotcha! for giving me all these neato tips and guidelines for the
                    map. If I didn't talk to him about it before I made this
                    pud, it woulda been unplayable. Thanks Gotcha!!

            Shlonglor for giving me some ideas on how to fix this pud. If he
                      didn't tell me how screwed up it was, it would have been
                      that way for ever :) Also for him putting my pud on his
                      page. Thanks Shlonglor!

            Vermeer for getting his ass kicked because of the peon popping
                    out order thing and then complaining about it :)
                    So when you're top right and you can mine the second
                    mine on your island without the peons popping out the
                    other side, you can thank Vermeer!

            Shadow! for being a general pain by nagging on me to fix this
                    pud :)

            Silverwolf for his attempt at fixing this pud without asking 

Pud Dedicated to: The Andrews Boys, so they can finally lose a on a water
                  maze type map since i've been told they suck at Maze :)
                                                          
For those of you who made it this far:

Differences between No way out of this Maze and the Water Maze

                NWOOTM:                 Water Maze v 1.1:

Passages:        Land                     Water
Mines:     16x40k total 640k          18x30k 6x40k total 780k
Oil:             None                 19x15k total 285k          
Width of
Passages:  Mostly 4 squares           Mostly 5 squares

Future Pud Ideas?

First I'll fix my X marks the spot 2 map, I've already got plenty
of feedback on how to fix it. It'll be more hectic than the first :)

Second I'll try to make a "colonize the continent" type map. You'll
start on a small island with little resources. You have 2 decisions: to either
quickly go to your opponents island and destroy him, or to quickly get
to the continent and expand.

Enjoy and have fun!
